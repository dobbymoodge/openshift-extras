# = upgrade.rb: node host upgrade and migration integration via mcollective

#
# == Description
#
# upgrade.rb for mcollective is used during upgrades of OpenShift Enterprise
# node hosts.
#
# Like the rest of the upgrade code, this code should be as simple, generic,
# and future-proof as possible. Specifics for each upgrade must be reserved
# for upgrade-specific code. Expect this same code to be used for upgrading
# very old versions as well as the latest. It should not be changed if it is
# at all possible, and then only to make optional additions.
