After going through
http://libraonprem.etherpad.corp.redhat.com/rhel6-origin-setup you can use this
document to verify you have a working installation.

== For all cartridges ==
rhc domain create -ladmin -padmin -n mydomain

== JBoss & Jenkins ==
Here's how to get up and running using the rhc tool:
rhc app create -a myjbossapp1 -t jbossas-7 -p admin
rhc app create -a jenkins -t jenkins-1.4 -p admin
rhc-ctl-app -a myjbossapp1 -e add-jenkins-client-1.4 -p admin

If you would like to see everything done from a fancy GUI read the following:
	[regular eclipse]
		* Download eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/indigosr2
		* Install the JBoss Tools plugin
  			https://openshift.redhat.com/community/faq/how-do-i-install-the-jboss-openshift-tools-plugin-for-eclipse
		* Set libra_server in eclipse.ini according to
  			https://openshift.redhat.com/community/wiki/connect-to-openshift-origin-installation-with-jboss-tools
  	[JBoss Developer Studio 5GA]
  		* Download and install from RH Customer Portal - comes with OpenShift plugins
		* Set libra_server in jbdevstudio.ini according to
  			https://openshift.redhat.com/community/wiki/connect-to-openshift-origin-installation-with-jboss-tools
  			OR copy jbdevstudio.ini file, edit with -Dlibra_server=$SERVERIP, and use --launcher.ini your_file.ini 
  				from the command line
  			OR specify -vmargs -Dlibra_server=$SERVERIP from the command line

One thing to note is that the rhc tool will create a set of ssh keys if it
doesn't find any available.  The eclipse tools will not.  What I've been doing
is copying the ssh keys that rhc creates locally on my broker over to my laptop
so that I can test eclipse there.

Another thing is is needed if you want to use either rhc or eclipse outside of
the broker node is to add the broker's IP to your local system's
/etc/resolv.conf.  This is a crude workaround until we have a better idea of
how we should integrate with DNS.
